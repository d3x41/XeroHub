### Information

Some of you out there keep calling me an **Arch** & **KDE Plasma** shill. To which I would like to reespond with, what's wrong with that ? I mean, why do you find it so strange for one to use what one likes if it works for them and stick with it ? I like what I like, never had any strange and deal breaking issues that affected my day to day.

![Issues](https://i.imgur.com/6L7eG23.jpeg)

That's not to say that issues do not exist, oh they do. But, in my case, for my specific usage, none of them were severe enough to cause me to move away. Annoying, yes, but not deal breaking. I did try many other DEs, like **Gnome**, **XFCE**, **Cinnamon**, even **Hyprland**, none of which worked for me. I found myself having to force myself to adapt to them, while with **KDE Plasma** not so much, it reflects my personality.

I also tried many other Distros, like **Fedora** and many of its spins, **Debian Sid**, **OpenSuse**, **uBlue Aurora**, all with **Plasma**, none of which I could adapt to. **Arch** just works for me, it's super easy to fix when issues do happen.

Oh, I forgot to mention that I am not much of a gamer, so there's that too. If I do play games I have never experienced `120fps` or higher, am used `60fps`, so am fine with that. My current hardware cannot do any better anyway...

Just wanted to cover these facts before moving on with the Hardware & Software I use...

### The Software

- **Linux Distro :**

I love working with **ArchLinux** in all its forms. It's the most flexible Distro I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Allowing me to build things from the ground up without it being too complex, or getting in my way. That's why all my systems run it or one of its spins.

To summarize, I use **Vanilla Arch** on main rig, **XeroLinux** on HomeLab and **Manjaro** on HTPC. As you can see Arch is at the core of every OS I use.

- **Desktop Environment :**

As for the Desktop Environment I love working with, it's none other than **KDE Plasma**, simply because it's so damn beautiful, and easy to work with. And since I am more of a visual old geezer, it fits my needs so well it ain't a joke. That's why I don't see myself using anything else for a long time to come.

**Note :**

> I do dabble with other Non-Arch Distros and other DEs from time to time to keep my knowledge fresh, and to post about them on this here site.

### The Hardware

I do own many, 3 Desktops, 2 Laptops and a Mini PC. Main, NAS, Home-Lab & HTPC. Laptops are unimportant just runs my shop and testing various Distros.

**The Beast :**

Main rig, the one I do all my *Development*, *Gaming* and other things on, which I label as **StationXero**.

I know the `GTX 1080` is an aging GPU, trust me I am trying to raise money to replace it with at least an `RTX 3080/3090`. I could use better **Wayland** support. Am not really a gamer though, so that part I do not perticularly care about.

**Home-Lab/Proxmox Server :**

This Mini PC I call **XeroLab**, as the name implies, is my **Home-Lab** PC, it runs all my **Docker Containers** as well as my **Proxmox** server. It has `16GB RAM` with a `Ryzen 5 7530U`.

That thing is not showing any signs of slowing down. It's a great little machine. If you want to get one for yourself you can find it here on their [**Official Site**](https://genmachine.tech/products/ren7000-7530u?variant=45301439693085)

**NAS/Storage :**

Another desktop I call **XeroNAS**, as the name implies, is my **NAS** PC, it stores all my personal data as well as my Linux ISOs & GOG game installers. It has `8GB RAM` with a `Ryzen 5 3600X` and an old `GT-710` GPU.

That thing is running [**OpenMediaVault**](https://www.openmediavault.org) for managing all the storage. I personally love it for its simplicity and ease of use. It ain't much but it works.

**The HTPC :**

Finally there's my HTPC, which has `Core-i7 6800K`, with a `GTX 650 Ti-Boost OC` (Soon my GTX1080) GPU, and `32GB RAM`. Now with it being my HTPC, it has 14 Drives of various sizes totalling `~68TB` of storage.

The only app installed on that thing is [**Plex Server**](https://plex.tv) as a *Snap*.

### Other systems

Now I do have a few other systems that don't do much. Mainly my **Lenovo Thinkpad T14 Gen 1** that I use in the office, with 1Tb nVme, a `Ryzen 5 PRO 4650U`, 16Gb RAM and an iGPU. As for the other laptop I have it's an old **MacBook Pro** from 2016, yeah the one with the butterfly keyboard n thouchbar. I barely use that thing relegated to a shelf somewhere.

Finally I have the awesome **SteamDeck**, yep I managed to snag one. It's now my *Retro Gaming Console* with [**Batocera**](https://xerolinux.xyz/posts/retro-deck/)  running the show. I absolutely love it !

### Thanks for reading

That's it folks. Now you have a better idea of what equipment I use on a daily basis to bring you everything I do. I did not list all the softwares I use coz it's a long list that varies a lot. Thanks for reading.
