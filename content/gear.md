### Information

Some people call me an **Arch** & **KDE Plasma** shill, and I don't see the problem with that. I use what works for me, and **Arch** has been great. Sure, there are issues, but none have been deal-breakers for my use case. I've tried other distros, but **Arch** is the one I can easily adapt to and fix when problems arise. 

Just wanted to cover these facts before moving on with the Hardware & Software I use...

### The Hardware

I do own many, 3 Desktops, 2 Laptops and a Mini PC. Main, NAS, Home-Lab & HTPC. Laptops are unimportant just runs my shop and testing various Distros.

**The Beast :**

Main rig, the one I do all my *Development*, *Gaming* and other things on, which I label as **StationXero**.

It was recently upgraded to an `RX 7800XT` and a `Ryzen 9 5950X`. I now use **KDE Wayland** on the daily. I am enjoying it so much better now.

**Home-Lab/Proxmox Server :**

This Mini PC I call **XeroLab**, as the name implies, is my **Home-Lab** PC, it runs all my **Docker Containers** as well as my **Proxmox** server. It has `32GB RAM` after upgrade, with a `Ryzen 5 7530U`.

That thing is not showing any signs of slowing down. It's a great little machine. If you want to get one for yourself you can find it here on their [**Official Site**](https://genmachine.tech/products/ren7000-7530u?variant=45301439693085)

**NAS/Storage :**

Another desktop I call **XeroNAS**, as the name implies, is my **NAS** PC, it stores all my personal data as well as my Linux ISOs & GOG game installers. It has `8GB RAM` with a `Ryzen 5 3600X` and an old `GTX 650 Ti Boost-OC` GPU.

That thing is running [**OpenMediaVault**](https://www.openmediavault.org) for managing all the storage. I personally love it for its simplicity and ease of use. It ain't much but it works.

**The HTPC :**

Finally there's my HTPC, which has `Core-i7 6800K`, with a `GTX 1080` GPU, and `32GB RAM`. Now with it being my HTPC, it has 14 Drives of various sizes totalling `~68TB` of storage.

The only app installed on that thing is [**Plex Server**](https://plex.tv) as a *Snap*.

**Laptop :**

It is my **Lenovo Thinkpad T14 Gen 1** that I use in the office, with `1Tb nVme`, a `Ryzen 5 PRO 4650U`, `16Gb RAM` and an iGPU.

I mainly use this thing for testing other Distros and configs. It never stays on the same OS longer than a month or two. I love it, everything I throw at it works without any issues. It will never see **Windows** mark my words. It's the most **Linux** friendly laptop on the market today... 

### Other systems

Now I do have a few other systems that I don't use much if at all, just sitting here collecting dust as decorative pieces. An old **MacBook Pro** from 2016, yeah the one with the faulty butterfly keyboard n thouchbar. I barely use that thing relegated to a shelf somewhere.

Finally I have the awesome **SteamDeck**, yep I managed to snag one. It's now my *Retro Gaming Console* with [**Batocera**](https://xerolinux.xyz/posts/retro-deck/)  running the show. I absolutely love it ! Sadly I no longer have the time to use it, so it's now sitting behind my monitors teasing me lol ;)

### Thanks for reading

That's it folks. Now you have a better idea of what equipment I use on a daily basis to bring you everything I do. I did not list all the softwares I use coz it's a long list that varies a lot. Thanks for reading.
