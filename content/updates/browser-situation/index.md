Hey there...

This is a new type of post. Please read on to understand what it's all about. **XeroLinux** will be changing the browser included out the box.

### Current situation

In February 2025, **Mozilla** introduced Terms of Use for **Firefox** for the first time, accompanied by an updated Privacy Notice, aiming to provide users more transparency regarding data practices. The initial terms sparked confusion and criticism due to phrasing that seemingly granted Mozilla broad rights over user data, including a "nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license" to use information entered through the browser31. This raised concerns about potential access to personal information, saved passwords, and browsing history, drawing comparisons to data practices of major tech companies.

In response to community concerns, Mozilla revised the Terms of Use to clarify that the intention was to enable basic Firefox functionality, not to claim ownership of user data. The updated language emphasizes the limited scope of Mozilla's interaction with user data, stating that users give Mozilla the rights necessary to operate Firefox, including data processing as described in the Privacy Notice, and a license to fulfill user requests regarding content entered in Firefox. Mozilla also addressed concerns about selling data, explaining that while they do share some data with partners to keep Firefox commercially viable, they strive to anonymize or aggregate this data and detail these practices in their privacy notice.

### Action / Results

As a result of this, we, here at the **XeroLinux HQ** decided to run a poll asking you the users, to vote for a replacement. And the winner, by a huge margin was, [**LibreWolf**](https://librewolf.net), so we decided to switch to it.

But alas that wasn't enough. That decision backfired on us and ignited an unwarranted argument between users who voted for it and ones who had opinions against its developer and the philosophy behind it, for various reasons I will not go into in this post...

### Future plans

No matter what *big name browser* we decide to move to, there will always be some people complaining, we can't win. Not including any will also cause a riot.

For this reason, and since we do not want to be involved in these political wars, and with the project being apolitical, as in neutral, we decided to do what we should have done since day one, which is to stick to "placeholder" ones while we keep offering a big selection of others for you to install later on.

And those browsers are, [**Epiphany**](https://apps.gnome.org/Epiphany/) on the **Gnome** spin, and [**Falkon**](https://www.falkon.org) on **KDE Plasma**. We chose them because they are native to each Desktop environment, and more importantly completely neutral, thus staying true to our philosophy.

### Closing thoughts

We hope that this will put en end to the constant backlash. As we pointed out earlier, those are just there so you have a browser to use out the box. You then install whichever one you prefer through our toolkit. We will be adding more as time goes by. 

However, we cannot add every single one out there, as there are way too many. If you don't find the one you like on the list, just head on over to either [**Flathub**](https://flathub.org), the [**AUR**](https://aur.archlinux.org) or the official **Arch Repos**, and install it from there.

It's that easy. We apologize for this, but it had to be done to avoid any potential arguments and political discussions. Thanks for your continued support and understanding in this matter.

Cheers !
