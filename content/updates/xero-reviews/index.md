## Intro

Hey everyone! I’ve been paying attention to the Linux community lately and noticed something interesting, there aren’t many reviews or overviews of **XeroLinux** floating around. I’m guessing it might be because the ISOs are behind a *donation* wall, which could make it a bit harder for folks to access and try it out. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure why, but that’s exactly why I wanted to take a moment to write this post and clear things up. If you’re curious about **XeroLinux**, or if you’re someone who enjoys sharing your thoughts and experiences with your audience, I’d love for you to consider giving it a try and maybe posting a review on your channel.

## How to Reach Out

Getting your hands on the ISOs is easier than you might think. If you already have an account on [**Fosstodon**](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux), just send me a message there. If you don’t, no worries, you can quickly create an account using [**this invite link**](https://fosstodon.org/invite/VyhmPW4w). Alternatively, you can reach out on [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu). No access to those platforms ? Ok how about a simple [**E-mail**](mailto:steve@techxero.com). Just drop me a link to your channel or platform where you’d like to share your review, and I’ll send you a private download link for one or both ISOs, free of charge of course.

To be clear, I’m not asking you to give a glowing review or say anything you don’t truly believe. Honest, genuine feedback is what matters most to me and the community. If you want, we can even have a quick chat before you start so I can walk you through some of the key features and unique aspects of **XeroLinux**. That way, you’ll have a solid understanding to help shape your content. But really, there’s no pressure, just an open invitation.

## Why I’m Asking

**Here’s the honest truth:** without reviews and visibility, fewer people learn about XeroLinux, which means less support and fewer donations. Right now, donations are the primary way I keep the project alive and growing. So when you share a review or overview, you’re not just helping me, you’re helping the entire community by bringing more eyes and interest to the project. It’s a win-win! You get to keep the ISOs for free, explore a cool Linux distro, and help a grassroots project gain momentum without spending a dime.

## Closing Words

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and consider helping out. Whether you’re a seasoned reviewer, a Linux enthusiast, or just someone curious about new distros, your voice matters. Every review, big or small, helps build awareness and encourages others to give **XeroLinux** a try. I’m really excited to connect with more people who share a passion for open source and innovation. Feel free to reach out anytime, I’m here to support you and answer any questions you might have. Together, we can make **XeroLinux** something truly special. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Cheers :heart:
