# Breaking News: XeroLinux Goes Quarterly!

Hey there, fellow tech wizards and Linux enthusiasts!

It's time for a major update (pun intended) on the **XeroLinux** front. Due to the lack of earth-shattering new features and major upgrades from both **KDE** & **Gnome**, we've decided to switch gears and adopt a quarterly release schedule. That's right; you'll get your hands on bigger and more awesome updates every three months unless something revolutionary comes along (and let's be honest, who doesn't love a good surprise?).

## The New Plan

- **Stability First**: To keep things as smooth as possible, we're putting the brakes on major tweaks for now, while we do more stability testing. However, smaller but super useful changes/tweaks will continue to sneak their way into future releases.
  
- **Toolkit Time**: We're shifting focus to our toolkit, making it the ultimate sidekick for both **Vanilla ArchLinux** (regardless of your DE or WM preferences) and **XeroLinux** fans. This was always the plan: creating something versatile that works beautifully across different setups.

  **Important Note**: Our toolkit is designed to play nicely with *Vanilla* **ArchLinux** and **XeroLinux** itself. However, if you're using any derivatives outside these two, things might get a bit complicated due to potential conflicts with existing modifications.

- **Quarterly Releases Ahead**: Both **KDE Plasma** and **Gnome** versions of **XeroLinux** will follow this new quarterly schedule. You can still expect the same level of quality and stability that has become synonymous with our distro.

## No Need to Panic

Worry not though! As long as you're rocking **XeroLinux** like a pro, keeping those updates flowing when they arrive, and using our snazzy "**Apply latest XeroLinux specific changes/updates**" option, you won't be missing out on much action! This change will take place after **March**.

ISOs will continue to be available for new users in the mean-time, just make sure first thing you do post-install is update and reboot your PC in order to benefit from latest features. (You don't want to be behid the rest now, do you?)

## A Big Thank You

We appreciate your understanding in this shift towards more strategic development. Your loyalty and support mean everything! Stick around; exciting times are ahead!

Stay geeky y'all...
